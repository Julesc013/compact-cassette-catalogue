# Compact Cassette Catalogue

**Cataloging application for blank compact cassette tapes.**

See [changes](CHANGELOG.md "C3 Changelog"), [planned features](TODO.md "C3 To-Do List"), and the [wiki](https://github.com/Julesc013/compact-cassette-catalogue/wiki "C3 Wiki").

## What is it?

*Compact Cassette Catalogue* (hereafter *C3*) allows you to build up a catalogue of your blank cassettes.
It is a **user friendly** and **feature rich** alternative to a database.

## Who is it for?

*C3* is intened for tapeheads who may be finding it **difficult to manage their large collection** of cassettes and need a system for **indexing, sorting and searching**.

I created *C3* for myself because:
1. I prefer *aesthetically minimal j-cards* which are often devoid of useful information...
Which Dolby did I use when I recorded this?
2. I find it handy to be able to open up a list view of all my blank tapes, filter for the brand, type and length I want, and easily *select the perfect tape* for my new mix.

Note: *C3* is not geared towards *pre-recorded* tapes ([Discogs](https://www.discogs.com/ "Discogs - Music Database and Marketplace") does that job exceptionally) though it is fully capable.

## Why is it better?

This program provides many helpful features such as:
- *Search functionality* to assist in navigating large catalogues.
- *List views* to browse catalogued items.
- *Data visualisations* to track changes to the catalgoue.

Many pieces of information can be stored about each **tape**, such as:
- Manufacturer/Brand
- Model/Name
- Series year
- Length
- Type
- Region
- Condition

And much more information can be stored about the **recordings** on each side, including:
- Deck model
- Input type
- Peak level
- Noise reduction
- Speed
- Bias and EQ
- Contents

You can even **catalogue your tape decks** (including their specifications).

*Catalogues are stored as XML files for ease of use and can be easily transfered between devices.*
